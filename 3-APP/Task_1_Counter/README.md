## Discription
- This is a simple 4-digit counter app. It uses 4 SSDs to display the counter value and 3 buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the counter. The counter value is initialized to 1234 and is incremented/decremented when the corresponding button is pressed. The counter value is reset to 0 when the reset button is pressed. The counter value is displayed on the SSDs.
- The maximum value to be displayed on the 4 SSDs is 9999, and the minimum value is 0000.
