# Reset and clock control (RCC) peripheral 
is used to control the internal peripherals, as well as the reset signals and clock distribution.
The RCC gets several internal (LSI, HSI and CSI) and external (LSE and HSE) clocks. They are used as clock sources for the hardware blocks, either directly or indirectly, via the PLL that allow to achieve high frequencies.
There are three
## clock sources can be used to drive the system clock 
1.   **HSI oscillator clock**
2.   **HSE oscillator clock**
3.   **PLL clock**
